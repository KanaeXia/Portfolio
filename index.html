	 <p>Dear Hiring Representative:</p>
	 <p>I am a graduate from Stony Brook University, who graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Arts.  I have recently found out about the position available through LinkedIn.  I am excited to learn about this opportunity so that I may begin applying my academic learning to contribute to a larger purpose.</p>
	 <p>As a graduate of the computer science major, I have gone through courses that taught the core concepts of software development and required us to apply our skills to develop an application.  In my software engineering course, a team of five people, including I, created an online testing registration website where teachers and students can organize examination events.  Also, in my computer networking course learned about using TCP/IP protocol to transfer data.</p>
	 <p>Additionally, I have gained valuable experience in application development through positions such as Assistant Programmer for an online private server of Runescape and afterwards working independently on my own server, and Lead Developer of my own independently made games: Sale Rush and Make Love Not War.  While I am not confident these games measure up to a quality in which they can be sold, I am proud of the work I have put into these two projects to make a game based on original ideas.  I gained new perspective on positions such as these when I took a teaching job at Genius Design Lab for teaching students how to make their own video games on multiple platforms including VR/AR.  While these activities may be more focused on Video Game Development, I came to the conclusion that development of games and software are not all too different in terms of the process followed and the paradigm used.</p>
	 <p>Under the employment of The Glimpse Group for three years gave me a plethora of insight into the professional world of software development and teamwork. I worked in three different branches and in groups of more than four people each time, developing applications for corporate clients.  This work experience is invaluable and taught me much of what I know today about my work experience.</p>
	 <p>Being taught in many of these disciplines described above as well as in soft skills from other courses, I hope I can be a contribution to the force that drives this company’s success. Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing back.</p>
	 <p>Sincerely,</p>
	 <p>Simon Ou Yang</p>
